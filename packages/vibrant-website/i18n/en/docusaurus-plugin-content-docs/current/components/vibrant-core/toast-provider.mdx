# ToastProvider

`<ToastProvider />` is a provider which should be positioned in the upper layer of the application to use `<Toast />` properly.

## How to use

```jsx
import { ToastProvider } from '@vibrant-ui/components';
const App = () => {
  <VibrantProvider>
    {/* Your other providers */}
    <ToastProvider>{/* Your app contents */}</ToastProvider>
  </VibrantProvider>;
};
```

After inserting `<ToastProvider />`, read [here](../vibrant-component/toast) to trigger Toast.
