# Motion

export const MotionPaper = ({
  children,
  ...motionProps
}) => (
  <Motion {...motionProps}>
    <Paper
      width={100}
      height={100}
      backgroundColor="primary"
      p={10}
    >
      <Body level={1} color="onPrimary">
        {children}
      </Body>
    </Paper>
  </Motion>
);

`<Motion />` is a component that plays animation without user interaction.

```jsx live
// import { Motion } from '@vibrant-ui/motion';

<Motion
  animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
  duration={1000}
  loop="reverse"
>
  <Paper
    width={100}
    height={100}
    backgroundColor="primary"
  />
</Motion>
```

## Properties

### children (required)

Animation will work properly only when children is a component that can take ref.됩니다.

```jsx
// animation will not working
<Motion animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 100 } }}>
  {/* error-next-line */}
  hello
</Motion>

// animation working
<Motion animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 100 } }}>
  <Box />
</Motion>

```

### animation (required)

`animation` prop can take all of the System prop. However, style properties that can work with animation only work properly.

Each property takes `from` and `to` which is set as start and end state of the animation.

```jsx
<Motion
  animation={{
    // O
    fontSize: { from: 8, to: 20 },
    // O
    p: { from: 0, to: 10 },
    // O (color token support)
    color: { from: 'primary', to: 'informative' },
    // X (must add an additional % to the `from` value.)
    width: { from: '0', to: '100%' },
    // X (cannot define value between from and to)
    overflow: { from: 'hidden', to: 'visible' },
  }}
>
  <Box />
</Motion>
```

### loop

Animation will be looping with `loop` property.
`loop` takes `true` and `reverse` as option.

- `true`: Animation repeats from `from` to `to` state one way.
- `reverse`: Animation repeats from `from` to `to`, and `to` to `from`.

<VStack spacing={20}>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    loop={true}
  >
    true
  </MotionPaper>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    loop="reverse"
  >
    reverse
  </MotionPaper>
</VStack>

### duration

애니메이션을 실행할 시간(ms)를 설정합니다.

duration 값이 0인 경우 [스프링 기반 애니메이션](https://developer.android.com/develop/ui/views/animations/spring-animation)으로 작동됩니다.

기본값은 0 (스프링 기반 애니메이션)입니다

<VStack spacing={20}>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    loop="reverse"
  >
    0
  </MotionPaper>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    duration={1000}
    loop="reverse"
  >
    1000
  </MotionPaper>
</VStack>

### easing

:::note

duration이 1 이상(시간 기반 애니메이션)인 경우 사용할 수 있습니다

:::

현재 `linear`, `easeInQuad`, `easeOutQuad` 애니메이션을 지원합니다.

<VStack spacing={20}>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    duration={1000}
    easing="linear"
    loop="reverse"
  >
    linear
  </MotionPaper>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    duration={1000}
    easing="easeInQuad"
    loop="reverse"
  >
    easeInQuad
  </MotionPaper>
  <MotionPaper
    animation={{ x: { from: 0, to: 200 } }}
    duration={1000}
    easing="easeOutQuad"
    loop="reverse"
  >
    easeOutQuad
  </MotionPaper>
</VStack>
