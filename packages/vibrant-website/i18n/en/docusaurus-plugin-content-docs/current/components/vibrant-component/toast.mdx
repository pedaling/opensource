# Toast

`<Toast />` is a component that deliver result of the user's action.

Toast usually contains a simple and important message to attract user's attention and automatically disappears after duration.

```jsx live
<Toast
  kind="success"
  title="Custom text is applied successfully"
  duration={3000}
  onButtonClick={() => {}}
  buttonText="Preview"
/>
```

## How to use

Basically, Toast is tiggered by hook which is provided by the `ToastProvider`.

Therefore you need to make [ToastProvider](../vibrant-core/toast-provider) wraps the application that you want Toast to appear.

Follow how to use guide in [ToastProvider](../vibrant-core/toast-provider) first.

`<ToastRenderer />` should be added in component that you want Toast to appear before triggering Toast by hook.

Note that the position of `<ToastRenderer />` in component code doesn't matter becuase Toast's position is set by the viewport.

Toast is mounted by the hook which is returned by `useToast` hook.

Toast is generated with the properties that were passed by through `showToast` parameters.

```jsx
import {
  ToastRenderer,
  useToast,
} from '@vibrant-ui/components';

const ContentWithToast = (props) => {
  const { showToast } = useToast();

  return (
    <VStack mt={200} height="100%" width="100%" flex={1}>
      <PressableBox
        onClick={() => {
          showToast({
            kind: 'success',
            title="Custom text is applied successfully"
            buttonText: 'preview',
            onButtonClick: () => {},
          });
        }}
      >
        <Text>Show my toast!</Text>
      </PressableBox>
      <ToastRenderer />
      {/* //You should insert <ToastRenderer /> like above! */}
    </VStack>
  );
};
```
